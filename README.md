# Supplementary materials for survival variable importance paper

This repository contains code to reproduce the analyses in ["Assessing variable importance in survival analysis using machine learning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12726) by Wolock, Gilbert, Simon, and Carone (In press, *Biometrika*, 2024+).

As of 04/27/2024, the variable importance functionality in the `survML` package exists only in development version of the package, which can be installed from GitHub by running

``` r
## install.packages("devtools") # run only if necessary
